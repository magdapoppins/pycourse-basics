# Python Basics
In this project you can find samples of many of the most basic syntaxes of the Python programming language. The samples are leaning on tutorials such as the [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) web tutorial and the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial). 

A special thanks to the [Coding is for Girls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hNd2uW8jTR5K3KBzRuG2A) channel for great examples of how to explain these concepts to people who are new to programming and IT!
